    <p>
      An obstacle-jumping game where you control the character with your body.
      Using a webcam and some pose detection, the game reacts when you physically jump.
      It’s a fun project that combines creative coding, computer vision, and game design.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>
      The way this works is by taking the webcam input and sending each frame to a pose detection algorithm.
      Once the algorithm detects where a person is, it’s easy to determine if that person is jumping or not.
      If we have a jump, we can notify the game so that it handles its logic (drawing the images, collision detection, sound, score, etc.).

    <h2>Commercial Applications</h2>
    <p>
      The technology behind it has real potential for commercial use, especially in marketing, events, education, and retail experiences.
      Imagine walking into a mall, a trade show, or a store and being invited to jump to win a prize or control a game with your body—no controllers, no downloads, just you and a screen. Here's how a game like this could be used commercially:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A branded version of the game with product, mascot, or campaign themes.</li>
      <li>Example: For a sports drink, players jump over fire pits and collect bottles for points.</li>
      <li>Shoppers can play for discounts or samples.</li>
      <li>Fun, attention-grabbing, and shareable on social media.</li>
      <li>Kids learn about nutrition, recycling, or safety through play.</li>
      <li>Ideal for schools, museums, and family events.</li>
      <li>Interactive booths to attract foot traffic at expos.</li>
      <li>Participants can win branded merchandise or enter raffles.</li>
      <li>Touchless interaction is ideal post-pandemic.</li>
      <li>It's inclusive and intuitive—if you can jump, you can play.</li>
      <li>Memorable experiences improve brand recall.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The cool thing about this game is that it can be customized with different graphics, sounds, and gameplay elements to fit any brand or campaign theme.
